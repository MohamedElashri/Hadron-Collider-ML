# Week4 assignment

In this task you have to design a prediction model that is able to discriminate the basetracks beloning to the electromagnetic showers from the background basetracks. The goal is to get the best possible score (ROC AUC). 

## The data files:
At `Week4` Release of this repository you can find the following files:

https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Hadron-Collider-ML/releases/download/3/training.tgz - archive with brick volumes filled with labeled basetracks
https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Hadron-Collider-ML/releases/download/3/test.h5.gz - volume with basetracks you have to discriminate
